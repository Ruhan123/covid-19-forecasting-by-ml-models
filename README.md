# covid-19-forecasting-by-ml-models
This repository is about making a prediction on the number of infected (confirmed, death and recovered cases) people by the Coronavirus (COVID-19).

In this repository, we are going to use stochastic processes in order to predict the number of infected people by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the next 30 days.
You can also make predictions for the next year, since it is very easy as you will see in the next section.

Building the prediction models
In probability theory, a stochastic process is a mathematical object usually defined as a family of random variables. Since our problem is a Time Series Analyses Problem, we are going to use stochastic processes that can help us determine i.e. predict the outcome in such situations.

If you are not familiar with Time Series Analyses, stochastic processes are the first thing you are going to met when you start learning, since they are generally understandable and easier than anything else.

In this article, we are going to show you the practical implementation on some of those, including AR, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA.
but i used only  sarima model here
